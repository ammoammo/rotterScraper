# rotterScraper
App for web scraping Rotter.net for recent scoops and displaying the result in a more modern way than the original site.

You can check a demo of [this app here!](https://rotterscraper.herokuapp.com/scoops)

This app was created for learning purpose and to get a more modern look for the scoops in [rotter.net](http://rotter.net/).

Rotter is a  Hebrew news site and my main way of getting news in Hebrew.

The original site [rotter.net](http://rotter.net/), has an old design and feel.
So I decided to give it a different and more modern look, atlist for the scoops page.

**All the data and content of this app belongs to [rotter.net](http://rotter.net/),
just with a nicer look. :)**
